### 1. Which of the following is an object and which is a basic type?
basic type: int, double

object type: String, Array

### 2a. What is a static method in Java?
the static method belongs to the class not the object and is intialized at execution

### 2b. Why does the main method need to be a static method?
Because the main methos is where the program starts its execution. Allows the JVM to call the method without creating an object in the class

### 3. What is the output of the following programs?
Program 1: Wrong

Program 2: Correct

### 4. Does the below program change the season? Why, or why not?
No, because change_season(season) can only refer to the season declared in main

### 5. What is the output of the main method below? Please explain.
Output: (X: 0, Y: 0) because this wasn't used, so it's going to refer to what x and y were set to in the class

### 6. What principle of OOP does the private declaration for variable and functions achieve? Explain.
The priciple that is achieved is encapsulation because of information hiding. 

### 7. In the Point class below, how does Java choose between the two constructors.
Java chooses between two constructors through method overloading, which looks at the parameters of the methods

### 8. For the below questions, when the class Point is referenced, we are talking about the below class, which you can assume is fully implemented and working as described:
### Say we want to make a class that extends Point with a method that can reflect a point across the X and Y axis:
### Which of the following implementations achieves this?
Option 4 because x and y are being declared, and get and set is public

### 9. If we add this constructor to CustomPoint: â€¦and then run this program, what is the output?
The program won't compile because super has to be the first line.

### 10. What if we switch line 1 and 2 in the previous question?
output: p(10, 10)

### 11. If we want to override sum_x_y in our custom point, but first reflect the point before returning the sum, which of the following implementations are valid? (Note: assume that reflect has a valid implementation) Explain your answer.
Option 2 is a valid implementation because refelct is called through "this" and x and y is returned through "this"

### 12. What is the point of the protected modifier? Why do we have it and how does it work in terms of inheritance?
the point is so that no outsider can modify it. In terms of inheritance, it's vital for organizing and implementing

### 13. Suppose we want to extend this to a FormulaOne class which has a make, e.g., Mercedes. Complete the constructor and toString() method.
```
public class FormulaOne extends Racecar {
    private String make;

    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String m) {
        super(n, d); 
        make = m; 
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Car #" + number + "Driver:" + driver + " make:" + make;
    }
}
```

### 14. Using the Racecar and FormulaOne classes above, if we had a main method in a different class than either of those. Does the code work at mark A or mark B or neither? Explain.
Neither work because were calling addsponser outside of the inheritance property

### 15.
